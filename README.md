# CSiAPIPlayground
A very simple playground for testing CSi API functionality

#### How to use :

1. Write some code that does something in the Playground.Play() method.
2. Open ETABS, SAP2000, CSiBridge, or SAFE.
3. Run this application. It will create a new process that has access to the cOPAI object that can be used to modify the CSi document.
